# TI TPS63070

> "The TPS6307x is a high efficiency, low quiescent current buck-boost converter suitable for applications where the input voltage can be higher or lower than the output voltage. Output currents can go as high as 2 A in boost mode and in buck mode."

Some featrures we like:

- Vin = 2 to 16V (so we can use 1S to 3S Lipo packs!)
- Vout = 2.5V to 9V (so we can get a true 3.3V evan with a 3.0V LiPo or a browning out supplies... i.e., it's buck-boost!)
- -40 to 155 deg C operation
- 2.4 MHz operation
- Pretty decent power saving (PFM mode)

## Design Inputs

- Vin is the MPPT output, which is usually 4.2 V
- Vout is 3.3V, probably < 50 mA peak (and usually < 1 mA)

## Configuration

- EN/PSYNC: Attach to VIN so that it's always enabled and always in PFM mode 
   - Note; EN compares to 0.8V, could always make a under-voltage test if we wanted to. R11 is there for this reason.
- VSEL is grounded so it has a non-floating input
- FB2 is floating (it's just a N CH MOSFET connected to ground)
- PG is pulled up high because everyone does it. Should be fine to leave floating, but...?
